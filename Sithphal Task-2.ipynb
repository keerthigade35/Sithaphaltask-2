These mutations, which are linked to a higher risk of developing certain cancers, are analyzed using machine learning algorithms that interpret gene expression data and mutation profiles. By incorporating these genetic markers, AI models predict cancer progression and suggest personalized treatments. For example, patients with BRCA1 mutations might be recommended therapies like PARP inhibitors, while those with TP53 mutations may receive targeted therapies to address specific cancer pathways.\n",
